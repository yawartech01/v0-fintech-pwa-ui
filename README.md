```

## Data Layer

The app uses a mock data store (`src/lib/data-store.ts`) that:
- Persists all state to localStorage
- Provides type-safe CRUD operations
- Simulates API behavior for demo purposes
- Includes: wallet, sell ads, bank accounts, referrals

Replace with real API calls in production.

## PWA Configuration

The app is configured as a PWA with:
- App shell precaching
- Runtime image caching
- Offline fallback page
- Installable with app icons
- Mobile-optimized manifest

Service worker is auto-generated by vite-plugin-pwa.

## Mobile UX

- Uses `100dvh` for proper mobile viewport height
- Safe area insets for notched devices
- Minimum 44px tap targets
- Fixed header and bottom navigation
- Scrollable content region only

## Monitoring (Optional)

Sentry integration is included but guarded by environment variable:

```bash
# .env.local
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn_here
```

Only initializes in production when DSN is set.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push/PR:
1. Format check
2. Lint
3. Type check
4. Build
5. Playwright E2E tests
6. Lighthouse CI (performance audits)

Commented workflow section for Sentry releases with sourcemaps.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for configuration options.

All environment variables are optional - app works without them.
